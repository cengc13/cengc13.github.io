title: Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification-Midway Blog
---

This blog is the second of the three blogs documenting my entry into [toxic comment classification kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification). In the [first blog](https://cengc13.github.io/final-project-start-blog/), we introduced the dataset, the EDA analysis and some fundamental knowledge about a language model. To move forward, the primary purpose of the next step is to develop the baseline model from scratch. The essential components of a language model will be summarized, such as the tokenizer, the model architecture, and the evaluation metrics. In addition, we will cover some state-of-the-art multilingual models, such as BERT, XLM and XLM-RoBERT.
