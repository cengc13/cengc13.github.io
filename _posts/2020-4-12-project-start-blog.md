title: Jiasaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification-Starter Blog
---

This project is an ongoing Kaggle Competition. It lives at [toxic comment classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification). It is a natural language processing (NLP) task. I chose this topic as the final project because NLP is a very hot topic nowadays and I am new to this area. I hope to take advantages of this opportunity to learn more about deep learning targeted towards the state-of-art application in NLP. 

In this starter blog, I will walk you through the overview of the competition, exploratory data analysis, and  basics of language models for this project. The outline will be as follows.
